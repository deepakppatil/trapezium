## Installation

The easiest way to install doji is via the Python [pip](https://pip.pypa.io)
utility:

```bash
pip3 install doji
```

### Requirements - [Setup](DEVSETUP.md)
- Python 3
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io)

### Dependencies
Dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). Dependencies
are automatically installed during doji installation.

### Pre-requisite

```bash
# clone source code
git clone https://github.com/deepakpatil/trapezium.git
cd trapezium/python

```

Setup virtualenv as dev-env(you can use any name) under the parent folder

```bash
python3 -m venv dev-env
#activate virtial environment
source dev-env/bin/activate
```

Now install all the packages required for dev using `-r @file-name`

For TA-lib we need to first install talib using homebrew on MacOS

```bash
brew install ta-lib
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # has all the packages
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt # extended packages only requried for development purpose
```



Build and install
```bash
python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install
```

### Development

```bash
cp doji-config.env local.env
vi local.env # update environment variables accordingly

doji --version
```

#### Using the API

```python
# Python API examples go here
```

#### Running locally

Run tests like this:

```bash
python3 doji/tests/run_tests.py

# or this:
python3 setup.py test

# measure code coverage
coverage run --source=doji -m unittest doji.tests.run_tests
coverage report -m
```

You can also use jupyter notebooks as well. Install jupyter using `pip` currently its already installed as part of requirements-dev.txt, to start jupyter;

```bash
jupyter lab
